	<h3><u>Albums</u></h3>
<ul>
	<li>"Awaken, My Love!"</li>
	<br>
	<dd>This is Donald Glover's newest studio album. It has a old school funk vibe to it which really differs from his previous records. Critics love and hate it. I personally really enjoy the album, It is a nice one to just let play and chill out and listen too. Whether alone or with company. Give it a listen!  </dd>
	<br>
	<li>Beacuse The Internet</li>
	<br>
	<dd>This is Donalds second studio album. It has a strong hip hop and slow soul sound throughout. Donald shows in this album that he isn't just your tipical rapper, and that he can do other genres. This is his most popular album and contains most of his hits. It is my favorite lyrically. Most of his songs are just long strings of metaphors which build on eachother. He even made a screen play to go with the album! </dd>
	
	<li>Camp</li>
	<br>
	<dd>Camp is Donald's first studio album. It was released at the end of 2011. This album was a bomb according to most critics. He wasn't widely accepted into the hip hop community due to the fact that he was an actor and comedian at the time. The album has a couple of hits but some of the songs fall flat. Listening to this album shows where he started compared to his most recent music, which sounds almost nothing like this first album. </dd>
